# PHP-bank-form

This is a Bank form made with php, html & CSS.

You can access the fornt end from here - https://ferdus615.github.io/Bank-Form-/

As of my knowledg, as git doesn't support any serrver side laguage the back end code won,t be working here.

* The form is created through html & CSS
* The data retrival and showcasing is done by php here.

This is a simple first php assignment.<br>
So, there isn,t much but i have tried to incorporate a user friendly and easy design.<br>
I have also tried to incorporate some security feature for prventing XSS(cross server spricting).<br>

Will try to make a proper secure server side application in near future.
